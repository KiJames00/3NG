# 3NG
The Arabic Nonword Generator! Allows anybody to rapidly, reliably generate nonroots.

This uses Buckwalterâ€™s transliteration scheme, a guide for which can be found on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwalter_transliteration

## What it does

This tool generates a random string of 3 characters (corresponding to Arabic ones), then checks to make sure the string doesn't match any root found in Aralex, an Arabic corpus of >200,000 roots, link here: https://aralex.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/

## Download Instructions

First, make sure you have Python installed. Link provided here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Second, download the script and its associated data file from GitHub. Ensure they're within the same directory (I reccommend the name 3NG). 

Respond to the prompt, and enjoy your nonroots!

## Future features

I plan to add a prompt to generate plausible morphology or just the roots. At the moment, it only generates roots.

Potentially I'll add a UI but I'm very taken with the command line format right now.

If I add a UI, I'll also add a way to change the outputs to actual Arabic script.

Following maybe adding a UI and associated features, maybe I'll try to make a web version.
